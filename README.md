## Requirements
- Python 3
- PyTorch 1.6
- Open3d 0.8
- TensorBoard 2.3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Pillow
- tqdm

## Installation
Get the code.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/graspnet/graspnet-baseline.git
cd graspnet-baseline
```
Install packages via Pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Compile and install pointnet2 operators. (Code adapted from [votenet](https://github.com/facebookresearch/votenet))
```bash
cd pointnet2
python setup.py install
```
Compile and install knn operator. (Code adapted from [pytorch_knn_cuda](https://github.com/chrischoy/pytorch_knn_cuda))
```bash
cd knn
python setup.py install
```
Install graspnetAPI for evaluation.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/graspnet/graspnetAPI.git
cd graspnetAPI
pip install .
```

## Tolerance Label Generation
Tolerance labels are not included in the original dataset, and need additional generation. Make sure you have downloaded the orginal dataset from [GraspNet](https://graspnet.net/). The generation code is in [dataset/generate_tolerance_label.py](dataset/generate_tolerance_label.py). You can simply generate tolerance label by running the script: (`--dataset_root` and `--num_workers` should be specified according to your settings)
```bash
cd dataset
sh command_generate_tolerance_label.sh
```

## Training and Testing
Training examples are shown in [command_train.sh](command_train.sh). `--dataset_root`, `--camera` and `--log_dir` should be specified according to your settings. You can use TensorBoard to visualize training process.

Testing examples are shown in [command_test.sh](command_test.sh), which contains inference and result evaluation. `--dataset_root`, `--camera`, `--checkpoint_path` and `--dump_dir` should be specified according to your settings.
